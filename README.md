# Customer_Service_Analysis
This project explores the "NYC 311 Service Requests from 2010 to Present" dataset to understand patterns in public complaints and city service responsiveness. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and insights into temporal, categorical, and geographic trends using Python and Pandas. The project demonstrates practical data analysis skills applied to real-world city-level service data.

Project Steps

Data Import
Load the large CSV dataset containing over 300,000 records and 53 variables using Pandas.

Initial Inspection
Examine data structure, column types, and memory usage.
Identify key columns like Created Date, Complaint Type, Borough, and Agency.

Missing Value Analysis
Detect columns with high null values (e.g., Intersection Street 1, Vehicle Type).
Decide which columns to retain or drop.

Data Cleaning
Convert date columns into datetime format.
Drop irrelevant or empty columns to optimize memory and focus analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze complaint trends over time.
Visualize complaint types, borough-wise frequency, and agency response patterns.
Explore seasonal or hourly patterns in requests.

Conclusion & Next Steps
Summarize insights and outline how the cleaned dataset could be used for predictive modeling or service optimization.
